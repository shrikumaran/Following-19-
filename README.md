# Following-19-
Codes for my advanced line following robot for the Following'19 competition.

The competition involved detecting shapes printed out on papers where each shape had their corresponding coordinate, 
then this information is communicated to the robot via bluetooth.

The robot uses a Arduino UNO for processing and a HC05 bluetooth module. The IR sensor array was fabricated on a perf board with IR leds
and IR receivers.
